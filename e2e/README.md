# End-to-End (E2E) Testing for Lichtblick

This directory contains all end-to-end (E2E) tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The tests are organized and scoped by platform: **web** and **desktop** (Electron).

## 📦 How to Run

```bash
# Build desktop packages
yarn desktop:build:prod
```

```bash
# Install Playwright
yarn playwright install
```

### Web

```bash
# Run all web tests
yarn test:e2e:web

# Run in debug mode (step-by-step)
yarn test:e2e:web:debug

# View latest web test report
yarn test:e2e:web:report
```

### Desktop (Electron)

```bash
# Run all desktop tests
yarn test:e2e:desktop

# Run in debug mode
yarn test:e2e:desktop:debug

# View latest desktop test report
yarn test:e2e:desktop:report

# Run desktop tests in CI (headless mode enforced in Electron)
yarn test:e2e:desktop:ci

# Generate test summary with timings
yarn test:e2e:summary

# Run a specific test when developing (filename: uninstall-extension.desktop.spec.ts)
yarn test:e2e:desktop:debug uninstall-extens
```

## 📊 Test Performance Analysis

After running tests, you can generate a summary report showing test execution times:

```bash
# Run tests and generate summary
yarn test:e2e:desktop
yarn test:e2e:summary
```

The summary includes:

- **Overall statistics** (total tests, passed/failed/skipped)
- **Top 10 slowest tests** to identify performance bottlenecks
- **Failed tests list** with retry information
- **Total and average execution times**

This helps identify which tests are taking too long and may need optimization.

## 🧪 Filename Pattern

Test files follow the pattern:

```ts
{feature-name}.{platform}.spec.ts
```

**Example:**

```
install-multiple-extensions.web.spec.ts;
```
